# Deploying Laravel Notes App on Render.com

This guide will help you deploy the Notes App on Render.com using Docker with a free domain.

## Prerequisites

- A [Render.com](https://render.com) account (free tier available)

- A database service (You can use Render's PostgreSQL or [Railway.app](https://railway.app) for MySQL)
- [Pusher](https://pusher.com) account for real-time features (free tier available)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up the Database

#### Option A: Using Render's PostgreSQL (Free tier available)

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Create a new PostgreSQL database service
3. Note the connection details (host, database, user, password)
4. You'll need to change the Laravel DB_CONNECTION to 'pgsql' in the next steps

#### Option B: Using Railway MySQL (Free tier available)

1. Sign up at [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create a new project with a MySQL database
3. Note the connection details

   PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=your-pusher-cluster
   ```

7. Click "Create Web Service"

### 4. Get a Free Domain

#### Option A: Use Render's Free Subdomain

Your app will automatically be available at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

#### Option B: Use Freenom for a Free Domain

1. Visit [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com)

3. Register the free domain
4. In your Render dashboard, go to your web service
5. Navigate to "Settings" â†’ "Custom Domains"
6. Add your Freenom domain
7. Follow the DNS configuration instructions
   - On Freenom, add a CNAME record pointing to your Render URL

### 5. Verify Deployment

1. Wait for the build and deployment to complete (10-15 minutes)
2. Visit your domain to confirm the app is running
3. Check that all features work correctly

## Troubleshooting

- **If the app doesn't load**: Check the logs in your Render dashboard
- **Database connection issues**: Verify your environment variables
- **Real-time features not working**: Confirm Pusher credentials are correct

## Maintenance and Updates

To update your deployed app:
1. Push changes to your GitHub/GitLab repository
2. Render will automatically rebuild and deploy the updated version

## Additional Information

- Free tier on Render.com has limitations (like spinning down after inactivity)
